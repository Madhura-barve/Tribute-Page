                <p>Sundar Pichai, in full Pichai Sundararajan, (born June 10, 1972, Madras [now Chennai], Tamil Nadu,
                    India), Indian-born American executive who was CEO of both Google, Inc. (2015- ), and its holding
                    company, Alphabet Inc. (2019- ).
                    undar Pichai was born on June 10, 1972, in Madurai, India, and studied engineering at the Indian
                    Institute of Technology in Kharagpur. He earned a master's degree from Stanford University and an
                    MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

                    Pichai's early experience includes positions at Allied Materials and McKinsey & Co.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1997, Sundar Pichai abandoned the Ph.D. program at Stanford University, accepting his master's
                    degree in material sciences and engineering. He joined Allied Materials, a semiconductor
                    manufacturer in Silicon Valley, as a product manager before leaving to pursue an MBA at the
                    University of Pennsylvania. After graduation in 2002, Pichai accepted a position as a management
                    consultant at McKinsey & Co. Having roles of both product manager and consultant at two leading
                    firms, which require product strategy, execution, and team building, prepared Sundar Pichai for his
                    new position at Google in 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sundar Pichai's interview at Google coincidently coincided with the launch of Google Gmail. Unaware
                    of the new product, Pichai admitted his ignorance during his interviews and is remembered as the
                    candidate with "intellectual humility," which Laszlo Bock, Googleâ€™s former senior VP of people
                    operations, called one of the top qualities he looked for in candidates at Google. Pichai was
                    well-prepared but managed a dynamic situation with candor during a moment of uncertainty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pichai launched the Chrome OS and Chromebook in 2011, headed the Android operating system in 2013,
                    and became the leader of all products and engineering at Google by 2014. Pichai oversaw all of
                    Google's products and platforms, including Search, Maps, Play, Android, Chrome, Gmail, and Google
                    Workspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, Sundar Pichai stated that artificial intelligence, when machines are programmed to simulate
                    the human mind and solve problems and mimic human activity, "will have a bigger impact than most of
                    the breakthroughs in recent history" and "can make humans more productive than we ever imagined."
                    Pichai expects AI to play a foundational role in every aspect of our lives, by mimicking human
                    tasks, from healthcare and education to how we manufacture things and consume information.

                    In December 2019, Sundar Pichai became the CEO of both Google and Alphabet, replacing Larry Page.
                    Co-founders Page and Sergey Brin, along with former CEO Eric Schmidt, grew Google from a university
                    project to one of the most successful companies in the world.
